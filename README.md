# Air-Quality-test-using-Machine-Learning-Techniques
"This project predicts air quality using machine learning models trained on environmental data (PM2.5, NOâ‚‚, etc.). It classifies Air Quality Index (AQI) levels to help monitor pollution, support public health decisions, and provide early warnings for harmful air conditions."
